## Commits are Snapshots

![](images/git-visual.svg)

## Commits Have Two Parts 

- Part 1: Files you **stage** (i.e. include in your commit). 

- Part 2: A **commit message** that tells you what has changed since the last commit.

## Staging Files

- Which files do you want to include in this commit? 

- Think about it as: which files do you want to include on the stage?

- Include all files for now.
